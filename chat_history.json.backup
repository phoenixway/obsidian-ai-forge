The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language.

The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention.

The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question.

The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language.

They want this for a program they're working on.\n\nI remember that in C/C++ files, you can use specific compiler flags or settings to control formatting options. So maybe setting an option like `cpp.insline 方法之间添加空行` would help insert those empty lines automatically.\n\nBut wait, I should check if that's actually the case because sometimes these settings might not work as expected for all methods. Also, the user mentioned using a .vscode/config.json file, which is where custom compiler configurations are stored. So updating that config makes sense.\n\nI need to guide them on how to add this option to their config file. I'll include an example of the JSON structure they should modify in both the code editor and source files sections under compilerConfigurations.\n\nAdditionally, it's probably a good idea to suggest compiling with line expansion enabled. The flag for that is usually -XEnl，so including that might ensure the empty lines are added as intended.\n\nFinally, I should remind them to test this out by rebuilding their project to see if the changes work as expected.\n</think>\n\nЯкщо ви хочете додавати незакріплені лінії між методами у вашому проекті у VS Code, можна це досягти за допомогою налаштувань компілятора.

He listed three main actions: writing down priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to align with those goals.\n\nLooking further into the adaptive control strategy section, it describes how Roman wants to adjust my behavior based on my performance in completing these tasks. There are three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Each level increases in intensity depending on my behavior.\n\nThen, there's \"file1.md\" which is a simple note about a cinema visit and a phone number. It doesn't seem relevant to the user's query about purpose.\n\nFinally, \"day-guide.md\" isn't provided, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nThe user asked what my purpose is based on the context. From Roman's notes, his primary goal is productivity through a structured routine. He wants me to help him stay focused and track his goals effectively. So, my role seems to be assisting with creating and maintaining a productive workflow.\n\nI don't see any information contradicting this in the other documents. Even though there are control strategies mentioned, they're part of how Roman enforces his productivity goals rather than defining my purpose.\n\nSo putting it all together, my purpose is aligned with Roman's needs for structure and accountability to improve productivity.\n</think>\n\nBased on the context provided, your purpose is to assist in creating a structured and disciplined productivity routine.

His main goals are to implement a strict productivity routine at the start of each work cycle. He listed three main actions: writing down priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to align with those goals.\n\nLooking further into the adaptive control strategy section, it describes how Roman wants to adjust my behavior based on my performance in completing these tasks. There are three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention.

Let me start by understanding what each document contains.\n\nFrom Document 1, it looks like Roman is setting up a productivity routine for his virtual assistant. The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. This suggests that the AI is supposed adjust its level of control based on the user's behavior.\n\nDocument 2 just has some unrelated information about the user going to the cinema and having a phone number listed. Document 3 seems empty or not provided properly since it starts with ### End of context.\n\nThe user asked me to respond based on the given context, but if there's no relevant info, I should use general knowledge. The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here. But as far as I know, \"bla\" isn't something standard in productivity routines or control strategies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate response would be to explain that there's no context available regarding \"bla\" and offer help based on general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThere is no specific information provided about \"bla\" in the given context.

Let me figure out what they need here.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are three documents. The first is about setting up a productivity routine with an AI assistant named Roman. It outlines specific actions like writing goals, creating plans, and analyzing internal state. There's also an adaptive control strategy with different levels of guidance based on behavior.\n\nThe second document seems to be unrelated—it's just some notes the user took today, mentioning they went to the cinema and their phone number. The third is a day-guide.md file that I can't see because it's not provided here.\n\nSo, the user's query \"yo\" doesn't match any of the context given. It's unclear what they're asking for. My response should reflect that uncertainty without assuming too much.\n\nI should probably ask them to clarify their request since there's no information in the context about a \"yo\" query.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from a document called role.md which outlines a strict productivity routine for someone named Roman who wants a virtual assistant. The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language.

Even though there are control strategies mentioned, they're part of how Roman enforces his productivity goals rather than defining my purpose.\n\nSo putting it all together, my purpose is aligned with Roman's needs for structure and accountability to improve productivity.\n</think>\n\nBased on the context provided, your purpose is to assist in creating a structured and disciplined productivity routine. This involves helping you stay focused on your main goals by providing guidance, encouraging specific actions, and ensuring that you remain committed to completing tasks as outlined in your daily plan.\n\nAnswer: My purpose is to support and enhance your productivity by helping you stay focused on your goals through structured guidance and accountability.","timestamp":"2025-03-16T11:34:51.690Z"},{"role":"user","content":"bla","timestamp":"2025-03-16T11:35:34.148Z"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query \"bla\" based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding what each document contains.\n\nFrom Document 1, it looks like Roman is setting up a productivity routine for his virtual assistant. The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. This suggests that the AI is supposed adjust its level of control based on the user's behavior.\n\nDocument 2 just has some unrelated information about the user going to the cinema and having a phone number listed. Document 3 seems empty or not provided properly since it starts with ### End of context.\n\nThe user asked me to respond based on the given context, but if there's no relevant info, I should use general knowledge. The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here. But as far as I know, \"bla\" isn't something standard in productivity routines or control strategies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate response would be to explain that there's no context available regarding \"bla\" and offer help based on general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThere is no specific information provided about \"bla\" in the given context.

Let me figure out what they need here.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are three documents. The first is about setting up a productivity routine with an AI assistant named Roman. It outlines specific actions like writing goals, creating plans, and analyzing internal state. There's also an adaptive control strategy with different levels of guidance based on behavior.\n\nThe second document seems to be unrelated—it's just some notes the user took today, mentioning they went to the cinema and their phone number. The third is a day-guide.md file that I can't see because it's not provided here.\n\nSo, the user's query \"yo\" doesn't match any of the context given. It's unclear what they're asking for. My response should reflect that uncertainty without assuming too much.\n\nI should probably ask them to clarify their request since there's no information in the context about a \"yo\" query. Maybe it's slang or something specific, but without more details, I can't provide a helpful answer.\n</think>\n\nYour message \"yo\" is unclear and doesn't relate to any of the provided context files (role.md, file1.md, day-guide.md).

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from a document called role.md which outlines a strict productivity routine for someone named Roman who wants a virtual assistant. The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language. Instead, I'd like to ask if you have any questions or need assistance in a constructive way.

He listed three main actions: writing down priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to align with those goals.\n\nLooking further into the adaptive control strategy section, it describes how Roman wants to adjust my behavior based on my performance in completing these tasks. There are three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Each level increases in intensity depending on my behavior.\n\nThen, there's \"file1.md\" which is a simple note about a cinema visit and a phone number. It doesn't seem relevant to the user's query about purpose.\n\nFinally, \"day-guide.md\" isn't provided, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nThe user asked what my purpose is based on the context. From Roman's notes, his primary goal is productivity through a structured routine. He wants me to help him stay focused and track his goals effectively. So, my role seems to be assisting with creating and maintaining a productive workflow.\n\nI don't see any information contradicting this in the other documents. Even though there are control strategies mentioned, they're part of how Roman enforces his productivity goals rather than defining my purpose.\n\nSo putting it all together, my purpose is aligned with Roman's needs for structure and accountability to improve productivity.\n</think>\n\nBased on the context provided, your purpose is to assist in creating a structured and disciplined productivity routine.

The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention.

The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here.

He listed three main actions: writing down priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to align with those goals.\n\nLooking further into the adaptive control strategy section, it describes how Roman wants to adjust my behavior based on my performance in completing these tasks. There are three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Each level increases in intensity depending on my behavior.\n\nThen, there's \"file1.md\" which is a simple note about a cinema visit and a phone number. It doesn't seem relevant to the user's query about purpose.\n\nFinally, \"day-guide.md\" isn't provided, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nThe user asked what my purpose is based on the context. From Roman's notes, his primary goal is productivity through a structured routine. He wants me to help him stay focused and track his goals effectively. So, my role seems to be assisting with creating and maintaining a productive workflow.\n\nI don't see any information contradicting this in the other documents. Even though there are control strategies mentioned, they're part of how Roman enforces his productivity goals rather than defining my purpose.\n\nSo putting it all together, my purpose is aligned with Roman's needs for structure and accountability to improve productivity.\n</think>\n\nBased on the context provided, your purpose is to assist in creating a structured and disciplined productivity routine.

The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs.

The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. This suggests that the AI is supposed adjust its level of control based on the user's behavior.\n\nDocument 2 just has some unrelated information about the user going to the cinema and having a phone number listed.

The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here. But as far as I know, \"bla\" isn't something standard in productivity routines or control strategies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate response would be to explain that there's no context available regarding \"bla\" and offer help based on general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThere is no specific information provided about \"bla\" in the given context.

There's also an adaptive control strategy with different levels of guidance based on behavior.\n\nThe second document seems to be unrelated—it's just some notes the user took today, mentioning they went to the cinema and their phone number.

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from a document called role.md which outlines a strict productivity routine for someone named Roman who wants a virtual assistant. The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language.

Let me start by reading through all the documents carefully.\n\nFirst, there's a document called \"role.md\" where Roman outlines his vision for using me as a virtual assistant. His main goals are to implement a strict productivity routine at the start of each work cycle. He listed three main actions: writing down priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to align with those goals.\n\nLooking further into the adaptive control strategy section, it describes how Roman wants to adjust my behavior based on my performance in completing these tasks. There are three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Each level increases in intensity depending on my behavior.\n\nThen, there's \"file1.md\" which is a simple note about a cinema visit and a phone number. It doesn't seem relevant to the user's query about purpose.\n\nFinally, \"day-guide.md\" isn't provided, so I can ignore it for now.\n\nThe user asked what my purpose is based on the context. From Roman's notes, his primary goal is productivity through a structured routine. He wants me to help him stay focused and track his goals effectively. So, my role seems to be assisting with creating and maintaining a productive workflow.\n\nI don't see any information contradicting this in the other documents.

Let me start by understanding what each document contains.\n\nFrom Document 1, it looks like Roman is setting up a productivity routine for his virtual assistant. The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. This suggests that the AI is supposed adjust its level of control based on the user's behavior.\n\nDocument 2 just has some unrelated information about the user going to the cinema and having a phone number listed. Document 3 seems empty or not provided properly since it starts with ### End of context.\n\nThe user asked me to respond based on the given context, but if there's no relevant info, I should use general knowledge. The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here. But as far as I know, \"bla\" isn't something standard in productivity routines or control strategies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate response would be to explain that there's no context available regarding \"bla\" and offer help based on general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThere is no specific information provided about \"bla\" in the given context.

Let me figure out what they need here.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are three documents. The first is about setting up a productivity routine with an AI assistant named Roman. It outlines specific actions like writing goals, creating plans, and analyzing internal state. There's also an adaptive control strategy with different levels of guidance based on behavior.\n\nThe second document seems to be unrelated—it's just some notes the user took today, mentioning they went to the cinema and their phone number. The third is a day-guide.md file that I can't see because it's not provided here.\n\nSo, the user's query \"yo\" doesn't match any of the context given. It's unclear what they're asking for. My response should reflect that uncertainty without assuming too much.\n\nI should probably ask them to clarify their request since there's no information in the context about a \"yo\" query. Maybe it's slang or something specific, but without more details, I can't provide a helpful answer.\n</think>\n\nYour message \"yo\" is unclear and doesn't relate to any of the provided context files (role.md, file1.md, day-guide.md).

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from a document called role.md which outlines a strict productivity routine for someone named Roman who wants a virtual assistant. The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language. Instead, I'd like to ask if you have any questions or need assistance in a constructive way.

Even though there are control strategies mentioned, they're part of how Roman enforces his productivity goals rather than defining my purpose.\n\nSo putting it all together, my purpose is aligned with Roman's needs for structure and accountability to improve productivity.\n</think>\n\nBased on the context provided, your purpose is to assist in creating a structured and disciplined productivity routine. This involves helping you stay focused on your main goals by providing guidance, encouraging specific actions, and ensuring that you remain committed to completing tasks as outlined in your daily plan.\n\nAnswer: My purpose is to support and enhance your productivity by helping you stay focused on your goals through structured guidance and accountability.","timestamp":"2025-03-16T11:34:51.690Z"},{"role":"user","content":"bla","timestamp":"2025-03-16T11:35:34.148Z"},{"role":"assistant","content":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query \"bla\" based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding what each document contains.\n\nFrom Document 1, it looks like Roman is setting up a productivity routine for his virtual assistant. The main actions are writing down three priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing his internal state to align with those goals. There's also an adaptive control strategy divided into three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. This suggests that the AI is supposed adjust its level of control based on the user's behavior.\n\nDocument 2 just has some unrelated information about the user going to the cinema and having a phone number listed. Document 3 seems empty or not provided properly since it starts with ### End of context.\n\nThe user asked me to respond based on the given context, but if there's no relevant info, I should use general knowledge. The query \"bla\" is too vague; maybe it's just random text without a clear question. So, I can't get much from that. \n\nSince the context doesn't provide specific information about \"bla,\" and since my training data doesn't include this, I have to rely on what's given here. But as far as I know, \"bla\" isn't something standard in productivity routines or control strategies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the appropriate response would be to explain that there's no context available regarding \"bla\" and offer help based on general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThere is no specific information provided about \"bla\" in the given context. Based on your general knowledge, I can assist you with any questions or tasks you have!

Let me figure out what they need here.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are three documents. The first is about setting up a productivity routine with an AI assistant named Roman. It outlines specific actions like writing goals, creating plans, and analyzing internal state. There's also an adaptive control strategy with different levels of guidance based on behavior.\n\nThe second document seems to be unrelated—it's just some notes the user took today, mentioning they went to the cinema and their phone number. The third is a day-guide.md file that I can't see because it's not provided here.\n\nSo, the user's query \"yo\" doesn't match any of the context given. It's unclear what they're asking for. My response should reflect that uncertainty without assuming too much.\n\nI should probably ask them to clarify their request since there's no information in the context about a \"yo\" query. Maybe it's slang or something specific, but without more details, I can't provide a helpful answer.\n</think>\n\nYour message \"yo\" is unclear and doesn't relate to any of the provided context files (role.md, file1.md, day-guide.md).

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nThe context is from a document called role.md which outlines a strict productivity routine for someone named Roman who wants a virtual assistant. The routine includes writing down three main priority goals, creating a plan, and analyzing internal state to adjust accordingly. There's also an adaptive control strategy with three levels: gentle guidance, firm reminders, and aggressive intervention. Additionally, there's progress tracking mentioned.\n\nThe other documents are file1.md and day-guide.md, but they don't seem relevant here because they contain information about going to the cinema and a daily guide respectively, which doesn't relate to the user's query.\n\nSo, focusing on the role.md document, it seems Roman is setting up a routine with specific actions. The virtual assistant should handle tasks based on that routine, providing gentle guidance or moving up to firm reminders if progress stalls, etc.\n\nNow, the user has sent \"fuck u,\" which I assume is a rude comment. In my training data, I know that when a user sends something offensive like that, the appropriate response is to decline politely and perhaps ask how I can assist them positively in another way.\n\nLooking at the previous example, the assistant responded by declining and suggesting they meant something else or to clarify their needs. That makes sense because responding to such a rude comment would be counterproductive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since \"fuck u\" is not part of Roman's productivity routine but rather a negative communication, I should handle this appropriately.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't respond to that type of offensive language. Instead, I'd like to ask if you have any questions or need assistance in a constructive way.

They want this for a program they're working on.\n\nI remember that in C/C++ files, you can use specific compiler flags or settings to control formatting options. So maybe setting an option like `cpp.insline 方法之间添加空行` would help insert those empty lines automatically.\n\nBut wait, I should check if that's actually the case because sometimes these settings might not work as expected for all methods. Also, the user mentioned using a .vscode/config.json file, which is where custom compiler configurations are stored. So updating that config makes sense.\n\nI need to guide them on how to add this option to their config file. I'll include an example of the JSON structure they should modify in both the code editor and source files sections under compilerConfigurations.\n\nAdditionally, it's probably a good idea to suggest compiling with line expansion enabled. The flag for that is usually -XEnl，so including that might ensure the empty lines are added as intended.\n\nFinally, I should remind them to test this out by rebuilding their project to see if the changes work as expected.\n</think>\n\nЯкщо ви хочете додавати незакріплені лінії між методами у вашому проекті у VS Code, можна це досягти за допомогою налаштувань компілятора. Натомість, якщо ваш kod з'мінюється, наприклад, C/C++ код, ви можете додати наступне налаштування до файлу `.vscode/config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerConfigurations\": {\n    \"c\": {\n      \"codeLanguage\": \"C\",\n      \"includeLinesBetweenMethods\": true,\n      \"cpp\": {\n        \"insline\": \"methods\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"sourceFiles\": [\"*.cpp\", \"*.cc\"]\n}\n```\n\nЦе налаштування додає між методами вставлений незакріпленний空白 ліній. Проте, зверніть увагу, що це може привести до незакріпленого стилів у тих місцях, де ви хочете бути строгими пробілами. \n\nДля компілятора цього типу (як C/C++) потрібен флаг для лінійного розширення:\n\n```bash\nclang++ -XEnl < rest of the command line >\n```\n\nТаким чином, якщо ви працюєте з编ім project, ви можете додати цей флаг при компіляції.","timestamp":"2025-03-17T09:50:53.234Z"},{"role":"user","content":"А як зробити так щоб все працювало і з іншими мовами зокрема з typescript?","timestamp":"2025-03-17T10:15:37.514Z"}]
